    Self-regulated learning is a cyclical process, wherein the student plans for a task, monitors their performance,
    and then reflects on the outcome. The cycle then repeats as the student uses the reflection to adjust and prepare
    for the next task.
    The process is not one-size-fits-all; it should be tailored for individual students and for
    specific learning tasks (Zimmerman, 2002).

    The figure to the right illustrates the key steps of the process. These steps are performed by the student,
    but instructors play a vital role in guiding and coaching students through each step. The bullet points below provide
    additional information, and are drawn from Zimmerman (2002) and Zumbrunn et al. (2011).
