<p>“Time management” is the process of organizing and planning how to divide your time between specific activities.
    Good time management enables you to work smarter – not harder – so that you get more done in less time,
    even when time is tight and pressures are high.
    Failing to manage your time damages your effectiveness and causes stress. </p>
