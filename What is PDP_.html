    <p> "A Personal Development Plan is a written account of self-reflection and improvement, which doubles up as a detailed action plan used to fulfil academic, personal, or career based goals.

        It’s usually created within the workplace or when studying (with guidance from your manager or tutor), and works by allowing you to establish your aims, recognise your strengths and weaknesses, and identify the need for improvement.

        Objectives are put in place based on the areas you’d like to improve on, and the plan consists of your own personalised actions that will help you to achieve them."</p>
